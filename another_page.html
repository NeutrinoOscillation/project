	<p>The video above demonstrates a game that was created to demonstrate the neutrino oscillation phenomenon. The “Angry Neutrinos” game was named after “Angry Birds”, the popular game series, as both have the same concept: an object is launched with the goal of toppling a target. In this game, neutrinos are launched with a given initial speed and angle, which can be selected using the sliders. As the neutrino is travelling, it oscillates between its different flavour states and their associated mass. This has been simplified from the real model as the masses are discrete. The red represents an electron neutrino, blue for muon and green for tau. The mass hierarchy was 	set to be following the lepton generations. When a neutrino oscillates from one flavour to another, its mass and therefore its momentum change. If the neutrino collides with the target, the mass of the neutrino will impact the torque applied and hence the chance of toppling. Therefore an objective of the game is to collide with the target with the more massive, green tau neutrino. If the target is toppled, the game advances to the next level; otherwise, a life is lost. High scores are saved in the top left corner of the screen. This game was developed to be a fun interactive way of explaining neutrino oscillation to children in the late primary and lower secondary.</p>
