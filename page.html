	<p>The above video displays a physical model which has been produced as a resource for a demonstration to teach students about the neutrino oscillation. For younger students, they will be invited to insert a coloured ball into the Neutrinoscope via an opening on top of the machine. The ball colour will represent the initial neutrino flavour, in this model an electron neutrino which is originating from the sun, and this will be deposited into a tube. During a demonstration, the students will be following the propagation of the electron neutrino through space via spinning the dials across the face of the machine, to reveal what the neutrino flavour is at that planet. Each time a spinner is turned a coloured ball will be dispensed from the lower right of the Neutrinoscope revealing the neutrino flavour at that planet. A probability function was used to calculate the most probable neutrino flavour at each of the planets, so spinning the dial will only dispense the most probable neutrino flavour. This is because each spinner is linked to a tube, and the tube will only contain the colour ball of the most probable flavour. As shown in the video the colour of the balls being dispensed represent the neutrino flavour at that planet. With blue being the Electron neutrino, green being the Muon neutrino and finally the pink being the Tau neutrino. The model in the video represents a simpler version of the Neutrinoscope, where when presenting to older pupils, for instance GSCE students, the new Neutrinoscope is upgraded. This time when spinning the spinners at a planet, the neutrino flavour dispensed will correspond to the probability of detecting that flavour occurring at a particular planet. This is achieved by filling the tubes related to each spinner in proportion to the probability of each neutrino flavour being detected.</p>
