        <p>In the mid-1960's, whilst measuring the neutrino content transmitted to Earth from the sun, it was found that two-thirds of the expected neutrinos were missing. The sun produces neutrinos through the proton-proton chain nuclear fusion reaction. These then travel unimpeded by the sun's matter towards Earth, due to their leptonic nature. It was hypothesised that these neutrinos changed between three states in transit, an oscillation, which was confirmed by Takaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald from the Super-Kamiokande Observatory and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory respectively. They recieved the 2015 nobel prize. </p>
	<p>Neutrinos have three different mass states, with each flavour being a specific combination, or superposition, of each mass state. These are named m1, m2 and m3. The specific combination of m1, m2 and m3 are dependent on quantities called mixing angles. Three of these exist, one for every unique combination of mass states (e.g. 1-2, 2-3 e.t.c) and are determined experimentally. The plot below gives a visual example of how the different flavours are represented by the mass states for an arbitrary choice of mixing angles. The axes represent m1, m2 and m3, where the weighting for each state is plotted to portray each flavour: </p>

	<p>As the neutrino moves through space, the weighting of each mass state varies as a function of distance. With respect to the above plot, this means for a neutrino in an initial electron state (red line), this will rotate around the space as the masses vary. At some point in time, this will align with either the green or blue line, meaning that the muon will have changed its flavour to either a muon or a tau particle. Whilst the line doesn't align with any state, it is in what is called a superposition of states, which means that if it were measured at this point, there would a probability of measuring one of any state. Below, there are two animations: the first plots as a function of distance the probability of measuring a neutrino in a specific flavour state for a certain enrgy and initial state. The second animation shows how the neutrino moves between different weightings of mass states, with the colour representing the probability of the flavour state (follows the same scheme as the first plot). For in	stance, if the neutrino is magenta, there is an approximately equal chance of measuring either an electron neutrino or tau neutrino.<p/>
