	<h2>Neutrino Oscillation</h2>
	
        <p>In the mid-1960's, whilst measuring the neutrino content transmitted to Earth from the sun, it was found that two-thirds of the expected neutrinos were missing. The sun produces electron neutrinos through the proton-proton chain nuclear fusion reaction; these then travel towards Earth. To explain the absent neutrinos, it was hypothesised that these neutrinos changed between three states in transit, an oscillation, which was confirmed by Takaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald from the Super-Kamiokande Observatory and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory respectively. They recieved the 2015 nobel prize. </p>
	<h1>Ice Cream Analogy</h1>
	<p>Imagine an ice cream business, 'Neutrino Scoops', that is based in the sun. They make deliveries to all planets in the solar system, however, they only produce strawberry flavoured ice cream.</p>
	<figure>

		<figcaption><b>The 'Neutrino Scoops' ice cream van, based in the sun, only serves strawberry ice cream.</b></figcaption>
	</figure></br>
	<p>An astronaut based near Earth orders ice cream, expecting strawberry flavour. So the ice cream van traverses through space to arrive at Earth and delivers the ice cream to the astronaut. However, when the astronaut tastes the ice cream, they find that it is actually chocolate-flavoured! On closer inspection of the ice cream van's stock, the astronaut notices that the once strawberry-only supply now contains approximately equal amounts of strawberry, chocolate and vanilla flavours.
	<figure>

		<figcaption><b>An astronaut is surprised to find that he is served chocolate ice cream, despite only strawberry being produced. The entire ice cream inventory has now changed to consist of three flavours.</b></figcaption>
	</figure></br>
	<p>The ice cream van continues to Jupiter to make its second delivery to a different astronaut. This time, the astronaut tastes the ice cream and it is the strawberry flavour that they had expected. Still being peckish, the astronaut buys several more ice creams. Once again, they are shocked to find that one of the ice creams tasted was actually chocolate-flavoured.</p>
	<figure>

		<figcaption><b>An astronaut recieves the strawberry ice cream ordered, but after eating several more, they find that a small number of ice creams have changed to chocolate flavour.</b></figcaption>
	</figure></br>
	<p>So how does this relate to neutrinos? The sun produces one flavour of neutrino, the electron neutrino. When we detect the neutrinos on Earth, we find that only a third of them are electron neutrinos, with the others having changed to muon and tau neutrinos. These have changed flavour just like the ice creams in the analogy. What happens to the neutrinos as they travel? As the neutrinos travel, the probabilities of measuring each flavour changes, or oscillates, with distance. This means that depending on where you are when you are detecting the neutrino, the chance of measuring each flavour changes. This explains why the ice creams on jupiter were mainly one flavour, with only very few being chocolate and vanilla, because at this distance the probability of getting a strawberry ice cream was very high. When measuring a single neutrino, the flavour can take any form and may appear random, but when many are measured the percentage of each neutrino flavour will follow the same pattern every time for a fixed distance.</p>
	<h3>Neutrino Masses</h3>

		<figcaption><b>An example of how different combinations of neutrino masses m1,m2 and m3 make up each flavour. Image from <a href="http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/index-e.html" target="_blank">Super-Kamiokande website.</a></b></figcaption>
	</figure></br>
	<p>To reiterate, the neutrino oscillation means that as a neutrino travels, the probability of measuring it in its different flavour states changes. We will now introduce another feature of the neutrino oscillation, being the different mass states of the neutrino. There are three different neutrino masses, simply named m1, m2 and m3. Rather than neutrinos having a single fixed mass, their mass is actually a combination of each of the three mass states. This is called neutrino mixing. A certain percentage of each mass contributes to the overall mass, with the fractions of each state being added to give to the overall mass. This is called a superposition of masses, as the neutrino exists in each of the mass states at the same time. Similarly to the changing of flavour with distance, the contribution of each individual mass varies as the neutrino travels through space. For instance, if there is a high percentage of m1 at the sun and lower m2 and m3 percentages, there may be a lower m1 contribution and an increase in the others on Earth. Why is this important? Each flavour corresponds to a specific combination of mass states. If the masses are in this combination, then there is a 100% chance of measuring this flavour. However, as these mass states evolve with time, there is a chance that at a certain point, the combination will align with a different flavour. This is why the neutrinos can change flavour as they travel, due to the changing of the mass states that make it up. If the sum of the mass states don't align with any flavour, then this is when any flavour can be measured, with the mass state combination determining the probability. To visualise this, the plot below gives each mass state on the x,y and z axes. The combination of each state that makes up each flavour has been plotted. To date, the actual values of each mass is unknown.
	<figure>
	<img width="560"  src="3drot.jpg" alt="3D plot"/>
	<figcaption><b>Each of the three flavour states represent by the appropriate mixing of the mass states</b></figcaption>
	</figure></br>
	<p>As the neutrino moves through space, the weighting of each mass state varies as a function of distance. With respect to the above plot, this means for a neutrino in an initial electron state (red line), this will rotate around the space as the masses vary. At some point in time, this will align with either the green or blue line, meaning that the muon will have changed its flavour to either a muon or a tau particle. Whilst the line doesn't align with any state, it is in what is called a superposition of states, which means that if it were measured at this point, there would a probability of measuring one of any state. Below, there are two animations: the first plots as a function of distance the probability of measuring a neutrino in a specific flavour state for a certain energy and initial state. The second animation shows how the neutrino moves between different weightings of mass states, with the colour representing the probability of the flavour state (follows the same scheme as the first plot). For 		instance, if the neutrino is magenta, there is an approximately equal chance of measuring either an electron neutrino or tau neutrino.<p/>
